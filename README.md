# Hi! I'm Rylan.

I'm a Computer Science student at DePaul University pursuing a career in Full-Stack Software Engineering. I currently work as a Data Science Intern at BizStrat Technology and was previously an Application Development Intern at One Summer Chicago.

I have experience programming with:
- **C/C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **SQL**

At DePaul, I conduct quantum dynamics research with the Chemistry Department, building optimized simulation software to analyze how systems like photovoltaic cells can harness energy more efficiently. I also serve as Vice President of *SimplyCS*, a student organization aimed at facilitating accessible and inclusive programming tutoring for DePaul students of any major.

In my free time, I play bass guitar for my heavy metal band, [Claim Ursa](https://www.instagram.com/claimursa/). If I'm not jamming, I'm either losing at Mahjong, building LEGO, or barely getting enough sleep.

As a tutor and a musician, I'm interested in exploring how I can leverage technology in education and songwriting. I believe that, with care, modern AI tools can optimize learning experiences—not diminish them. I also believe in using AI ethically and creatively to write music of the future.

Interested in connecting? Don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for reading!
