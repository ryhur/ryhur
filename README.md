# Hi! I'm Rylan.

I'm a Computer Science student at **DePaul University** pursuing a career in Software Engineering. I previously did Software Engineering at Meeedly and was a Web Development Intern at **CAFÉCS**.

I have experience programming in:
- **C/C++**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript**
- **Python**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **SQL**
- **Swift**

I'm also familiar with frameworks and tools like **VS Code**, **IntelliJ**, **Git**, **React**, and **Django**.

At DePaul, I conducted quantum dynamics research with the Chemistry Department, with a focus on analyzing how systems like photovoltaic cells can harness energy more efficiently. Besides research, I served as Vice President and co-founder of **SimplyCS**, a student organization aimed at facilitating accessible and inclusive programming tutoring for DePaul students of _any_ and _all_ majors.

In my free time, I play bass guitar for my heavy metal band, [Claim Ursa](https://www.instagram.com/claimursa/). If I'm not jamming, I'm either working on fun software projects, playing video games, or trying to learn how to cook.

As a tutor and a musician, I'm interested in exploring how I can leverage technology in education and songwriting. I believe that, with care, modern AI tools can optimize learning experiences—_not_ diminish them. I also believe in using AI ethically and creatively to write music of the future.
